\section{PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY}

I work at the intersection of research and industrial programming (C/C++, Fortran, Python), where classical supercomputing (MPI, OpenMP) meets modern hardware (GPUs, TPUs, embedded ASICs) and performance optimization.

As co--founder of Purple Gaze Inc., I've developed eyetracking systems that are both more affordable and faster than many existing solutions.

I've earned my PhD from the University of Lausanne, where I developed specialized supercomputing software for economics and finance applications.

My expertise in CUDA, OpenCL, OpenACC, and Machine Learning has established me as an effective consultant in these fields.

I provide effective GPU--accelerated solutions to organizations facing complex computational challenges. My skills help teams successfully port legacy algorithms to utilize NVIDIA H100/GH200 GPU architectures, implement memory--optimized algorithms for better compute--memory balance, and develop portable cross--platform solutions that work reliably across different computing environments.

As a regular user of AI--assisted development tools, I incorporate LLMs into my daily workflow to improve productivity and solve technical challenges more efficiently.
